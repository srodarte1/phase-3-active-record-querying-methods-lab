AR Query Methods: Db handles all the logic and processing and sends the results back to the server and take that data, which will lessen the load of work that the server has to do, which will make application more efficient. Minimizes the amount of stuff you are putting on your server so it can handle other more complex queries.

The shows table corresponds to the Show class. you are more like.y going to be running class methods on Show.
AR uses self bc it allows that method to be inherited by other classes.
whatever class that gets called upon will be held down there? Not sure what that means. Show.maximum is not as reusable.

.where returns an array. Which one only returns one by default?


AR methods vs. Ruby methods.
There are so many more AR methods. We could use .limit(1)

.find_by returns as an object, and will return the first one in an object that meets our conditions.
